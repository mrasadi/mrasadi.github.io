## About

I am a software engineer with a strong research-oriented background in **computer software engineering, optimization, and intelligent systems**. I hold an MSc degree from Shiraz University, where my research focused on hybrid metaheuristic algorithms for solving complex inverse and combinatorial optimization problems.

My work sits at the intersection of **theory-driven optimization** and **real-world system engineering**. I am particularly interested in how advanced optimization and decision-making methods can be applied to large-scale, distributed, and autonomous systems such as UAVs and cloud robotics platforms.

Alongside my academic background, I have several years of industry experience designing and deploying production-grade distributed systems, which has shaped a pragmatic, system-level perspective toward research problems.

## Current Focus

My current interests revolve around:
- Metaheuristic and hybrid optimization methods for complex, large-scale problems  
- Decision making under uncertainty in autonomous and distributed systems  
- UAV path planning, scheduling, and coordination  
- Cloud robotics and real-time telemetry-driven systems  

I am especially motivated by problems where **algorithmic design, system constraints, and real-world data** interact tightly.
