## About Me

I am a Senior Software Engineer and Cloud Developer with a strong academic background in Computer Software Engineering. I hold an MSc degree from Shiraz University, where my research focused on combinatorial optimization and hybrid metaheuristic algorithms for solving complex inverse problems.

My work lies at the intersection of **optimization, intelligent systems, and robotics**, combining rigorous algorithmic research with real-world system design and deployment. I am particularly interested in applying advanced optimization and decision-making methods to large-scale, distributed, and autonomous systems.

## Research Experience & Academic Projects

**Master’s Thesis – Parameter Estimation in Signal Transduction Networks**  
Designed and implemented a hybrid **Scatter Search + Genetic Algorithm** framework for parameter estimation in nonlinear ODE-based biological networks. Developed a Python-based benchmarking and simulation suite covering networks with up to 39 parameters, achieving improved accuracy, robustness, and convergence speed compared to baseline approaches.

**Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem (MDVRP)**  
Architected a C# benchmarking framework for NP-hard MDVRP instances, integrating GRASP, Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, Genetic Algorithms, and Ant Colony Optimization. Enabled systematic performance analysis and achieved high-quality, stable solutions across multiple instances.

**Vessel Routing Problem**  
Contributed to a C++ benchmark suite covering 240 routing instances. Implemented ALNS and GRASP methods, consistently achieving near-optimal or optimal solutions and strengthening large-scale algorithm evaluation expertise.

**Orienting Problem with Hotel Selection**  
Implemented and evaluated multiple metaheuristic approaches to balance cost, distance, and customer preferences under multi-objective constraints.
